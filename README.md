# Active_internet_connection_checker

I find this solution from following stackoverflow answer , i will edited some syntax and remove optional printing part (but it in this code)

It use Data_Connection package in pub.dev
It use stream and listner
If you comment last three lines of it , it actively update connection status.(commented that in source file).
